Time Series Forecasting Using LSTM and CNN Models  
Implemented time series forecasting on the ETTh1 dataset using LSTMs, GRUs, and 1D CNNs. Preprocessed data, optimized models with dropout and early stopping, and evaluated performance using MAE, achieving improved accuracy over baseline models. Visualized predictions to analyze and enhance robustness.
